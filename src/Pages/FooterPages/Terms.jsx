        Welcome to our college fest website. By accessing or using this
        platform, you agree to the following terms and conditions. This website
        is developed to provide complete information about our annual fest,
        allow student and faculty registrations, manage event payments, display
        event results, and showcase media such as photos and videos from the
        event. It also includes role-based access for students, faculty members,
        and event coordinators. Only students and faculty members are eligible
        to register and use the website’s full features. Users are required to
        create an account in order to register for events, update profile
        details, and make payments. During registration and use of the website,
        we collect personal details such as your name, email address, phone
        number, college name, year and branch, gender, and profile photo. For
        payments, details are processed securely via Razorpay. We do not share
        any personal information with third parties other than those necessary
        to provide our services, such as payment gateways. Participants must
        follow specific rules set for each event.  These may include gadget
        restrictions or team-only participation formats. Users are responsible
        for adhering to all provided instructions. Once registration for an
        event is submitted, users cannot edit or cancel their entries. Failure
        to follow rules may lead to warnings or disqualification from events,
        depending on the nature of the violation. Some events on the website may
        involve a minimal registration fee. All payments must be made online
        through Razorpay. Once a payment is completed, no refunds will be issued
        under any circumstances. By participating in the fest, you agree that
        photos or videos taken during the event may be posted on the website or
        social media platforms. Additionally, any content submitted by you—such
        as essays or creative work—may be used by the organizing team for
        promotional or archival purposes. We expect all users to behave
        respectfully toward fellow participants and organizers, and to avoid
        misuse of the platform. Inappropriate behavior may result in a warning
        or limited access to website features. These terms and conditions may be
        updated at any time without prior notice. By continuing to use the
        website, you accept any such changes automatically. This document does
        not claim adherence to any specific legal jurisdiction and is meant to
        guide safe, respectful use of our fest platform. If you have any
        concerns or questions regarding these terms, please contact the fest
        coordination team.
