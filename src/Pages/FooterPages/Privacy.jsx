        We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal
        information with care. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        and safeguard your data when you use our college fest website. When you
        register or interact with our website, we may collect personal
        information such as your name, email address, phone number, college
        name, year and branch of study, gender, and profile photo. Additionally,
        if you make any payments, your payment details will be securely
        processed through Razorpay, our trusted third-party payment gateway. The
        information you provide is used solely for the purpose of organizing and
        managing fest-related activities. This includes processing
        registrations, enabling event participation, generating event reports,
        and communicating with you regarding schedules, changes, or updates. We
        do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third-party
        organizations, except for trusted services necessary to run the
        websiteâ€”such as payment processors and hosting platforms. All data is
        handled with strict confidentiality. We may post photos and videos taken
        during the fest on our website or official social media channels. By
        participating, you consent to your image or content (such as essays,
        artworks, etc.) being used for promotional and archival purposes. We
        implement reasonable security measures to protect your data against
        unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no online platform can
        guarantee 100% security, and we advise users to avoid sharing sensitive
        personal information unnecessarily. This Privacy Policy may be updated
        from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and
        continued use of the site implies your agreement to the revised policy.
        If you have any questions or concerns about how your data is used, feel
        free to contact the fest organizing team.
